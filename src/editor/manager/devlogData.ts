/**
 * Engine devlog entries, ordered newest first.

 * These are curated, plain-language summaries of the changes shipped to the

 * written for a non-technical reader so creators can quickly understand what is
 * new without having to read commit messages.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: an entry's `id` must stay stable once published. It is the value
 * stored in localStorage to remember which updates a user has already seen, so
 * changing it would make an old update look new again.
