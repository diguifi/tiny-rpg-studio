In the pixel art editor, pick None, Water, or Lava for any tile. Under Project → Visuals, “Enable effects” turns the look on or off for the whole game.

      'NPCs can now ask the player a question with two answers. Picking Yes or No shows its own message and can switch a variable on, so a single choice can change how the rest of your game unfolds. The decision is final for the whole playthrough — only restarting the game from scratch resets it — which rewards replaying to discover the other path.',
