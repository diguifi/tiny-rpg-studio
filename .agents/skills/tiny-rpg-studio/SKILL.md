# Tiny RPG Studio Project Skill

Use this skill when working in the Tiny RPG Studio repository.

## Project Context

Tiny RPG Studio is a web-based game engine and editor for making tiny top-down RPG adventures in a 3x3 world. It focuses on small, shareable games built in the browser.

Core authoring features include:

- Tile placement.
- Sprite, NPC, enemy, object, and interactable placement.
- Dialogs and player choices.
- Variables and conditional logic.
- Items and skills.
- Background music.
- Exporting created games.
- Shareable URLs that encode the entire game as compressed base64 text in the URL.

## Development Rules

- Always try the simplest solution before introducing a complicated one.
- Change the fewest files that reasonably solve the bug or feature request.
- Follow existing project architecture and local patterns before adding new abstractions.
- Add tests for new features and for bug fixes with meaningful behavior risk.
- Keep changes focused; avoid unrelated refactors.
- Avoid them, but when needed, code comments must be in English.
- Do not commit or push unless the user explicitly asks.

## Devlog Policy

For a major new feature or a large bug fix, add an entry to `src/editor/manager/devlogData.ts`.

Small bug fixes do not need devlog entries.

## Required Checks

An implementation task is only finished when all required checks pass perfectly:

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run test:run
npm run lint
npm run build:export
```

`npm run build:export` regenerates both `public/export.bundle.js` and
`public/tiny-rpg-studio-sdk.css`. It must be run so exported HTML does not use
stale runtime code or styles.

If any required check cannot be run, do not report the task as fully complete. State exactly which check was not run and why.

Plans are not considered implementation tasks, so if the task is about creating or reviewing a plan, these checks can be ignored.

## Implementation Guidance

- Runtime/domain logic should stay in `src/runtime/` and respect its existing boundaries.
- Editor behavior should stay in `src/editor/` and use the established editor services/modules.
- The editor should communicate with the runtime through the existing API bridge instead of reaching into engine internals.
- URL sharing and compressed game data belong in the existing `src/runtime/infra/share/` pipeline.
- Prefer project config constants over hard-coded values when behavior must stay consistent across editor and runtime.
